# TODOS

# Location view:
# field trial list either based on selection or last click; if too many (more than 50) show only for current year
# genotype list: make it also respond to current selection as above;
# use cache for already downloaded files: location list or field trials!
#     Check if there is a way to check on latest updates from sweetpotatobase
# location report: also make it better respond to selection and add other features; add report parameter widget
